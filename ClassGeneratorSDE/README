			   Class Generator 1.1 (for ArcGIS 10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program has the intent to generate model class from Esri ArcGIS geodatabase elements (like FeatureClasses, Tables, Domains, Subtypes and Relationships). His main idea is to simplify and be a base for common development from a common Esri developer.

It makes the understanding faster and the developing much more faster as you don't need to go to Esri application or documentation to find the correct structure of the geodatabase schema.

== Minimal requirements ==

In order to compile and execute the application, you must have the following the following requirements

     MS Visual C# 2008 EE	# See http://goo.gl/Lcuae
     ArcGIS Desktop		  	# See http://goo.gl/zRZQc
     libraries			   	# ESRI.ArcGIS.DataSourcesGDB.dll,  
						    ESRI.ArcGIS.Geodatabase.dll, ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry.dll, 
							ESRI.ArcGIS.System.dll, ESRI.ArcGIS.Version.dll


== Usage ==

    You can run from Visual C# 2008 Express Edition or from Visual Studio 2008 or later.
	You can also run from executable ClassGeneratorSDE.exe in the debug or release folder (created after compilling the code)

== Desired Enhancements ==

	# Hability to generate DAL with NET 3.5 lower or superior versions (get, set)
	# Add comments on Tables or FeatureClasses elements on Geodatabase (alias)
	# Add default value property to class
	# Add alias to each field on property description
	# Make templates to make many language generation (C#, Java, Pyton)
	# Add range domain values to domain classes (when happens)
	# Try to make at design time an exceptions (if technically possible)
	# Create an about screen
