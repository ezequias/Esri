			   Class Generator 1.1 (for ArcGIS 10)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program has the intent to generate model class from Esri ArcGIS geodatabase elements (like FeatureClasses, Tables, Domains, Subtypes and Relationships). His main idea is to simplify and be a base for common development from a common Esri developer.

It makes the understanding faster and the developing much more faster as you don't need to go to Esri application or documentation to find the correct structure of the geodatabase schema.
